I/O PS is small linux tool written in PHP 5.x that helps you to find processes with high I/O.

The tool is probably similar to iotop. However iotop requires Python version that is not available in many Linux distributions, especially RedHat and CentOS 5.x

I/O PS rely on I/O accounting information that may be found in Linux Kernel 2.6.12(?)+.
The info may be accessed in /proc/<pid>/io.

However kernel I/O info is not only disk I/O, but include all kind of I/O.
On big webservers you may find that Apache is the process that consume most I/O.

The way tool works is to collect I/O info for all runing processes, then it delays $PAUSE seconds and collects same information again.
After that it finds the difference between two "snapshots" and print first $COUNT processes at the output.

The tool also prints first $NAMELEN characters of the process name - similar to ps command.

The tool is completly read-only and must be started as root.
